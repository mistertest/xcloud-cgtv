 "World Premiere !"
 
 Yes i can say that, welcome to my Xcloud Beta for Chromecast Google TV.


## Context

Xcloud is the new Cloud Gaming Platform by Microsoft Xbox.
Xcloud was on private beta, during some months, and it's public now for all from the 28 June 2O21 ago.


The official Android App, exist only for Smartphone and Tablets at the moment, so there is no official App for Android TV and Google TV, for now.
You can only use "Sideload" with  the Smartphone App, but performances are not optimized and the Interface is not thinked and integrated for Android TV experience.

I was a lucky beta tester of the Xcloud Web App for PC: It's exectuted directly from the browser  on PC with the full HD resolution (1080p). 
I was thinking that it will be awesome if i can enjoy it directly on my box TV : The Nvidia shield Pro 2019.
So i decided to coding, an application for my shield TV for enjoying my games of my "game pass ultimate".
It was a good idea and excited project, for improve my skills in Android App development.

And now the version of the Application is maturely ready for the Chromecast Google TV in his first release.
